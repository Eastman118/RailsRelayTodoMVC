# Rails + Relay TodoMVC

This project demonstrates to expose an Relay-compatible GraphQL API with [graphql-ruby](https://github.com/rmosolgo/graphql-ruby) from an existing Rails app, and to build a React app with Relay which uses the GraphQL API.


## Setup

```sh
bin/setup
```


## Running

In development, you'll need to run `bin/rails server` with `bin/webpack-dev-server` to have the `app/javascript/packs/*.js` files be compiled as you make changes, and `bin/relay-compiler` if you change the GraphQL schema or any `graphql` tags in any JavaScript files.

If you'd rather not have to run the two processes separately by hand, you can use [Foreman](https://ddollar.github.io/foreman/):

```sh
gem install foreman
```

```sh
foreman start
```

The default port of the Rails Server is `5000`.
